This repo contains my practice programs while Iâ€™m learning Python.
The goal is to improve step by step, starting with basic concepts like variables, loops, and conditionals, and moving towards more advanced topics.

--Topics Covered--
->Variables and Data Types
->Operators
->Conditional Statements
->Loops (for, while)
->Functions
->Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets
->File Handling
->Mini projects (to be added later)
